## 📝 Recent Updates

### Medecin-Institution Table Enhancements (2024)
The `medecin_institution` table has been enhanced with additional columns to better track doctor affiliations:

**New Columns Added:**
- `date_affectation DATE NOT NULL` - Official assignment date (replaces date_debut functionality)
- `departement VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL` - Department within the institution
- `notes TEXT DEFAULT NULL` - Additional notes about the affiliation

**Migration Applied:**
- Migration file: `add_medecin_institution_columns.sql`
- Existing `date_debut` column maintained for backward compatibility
- Data automatically copied from `date_debut` to `date_affectation` during migration

This enhancement provides better tracking of doctor assignments within institutions and allows for more detailed affiliation management.
