## Technical Implementation Details

### üîß Services Architecture

#### API Services Created:
1. **hospitalService.js** - All hospital-related API calls
2. **pharmacyService.js** - All pharmacy-related API calls  
3. **laboratoryService.js** - All laboratory-related API calls

#### Key Service Methods:
- Patient search across all institution types
- Institution-specific data retrieval
- Status updates and workflow management
- File upload capabilities for lab results
- Walk-in patient creation (reused across institutions)

### üé® UI/UX Consistency

#### Design Principles Applied:
- **Consistent Theme**: All components use the existing medical theme
- **Color Scheme**: Primary (#4ca1af) and secondary (#2c3e50) colors maintained
- **Component Styling**: Gradient cards, hover effects, and consistent spacing
- **Icons**: Material-UI icons for intuitive navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with Grid system

#### Shared UI Components:
- Statistics cards with gradient backgrounds
- Tabbed interfaces for organized workflows
- Search forms with consistent styling
- Data tables with hover effects and status chips
- Modal dialogs for detailed operations

### üîê Security & Access Control

#### Role-Based Access:
- **Hospital Role**: Access to hospital dashboard and patient management
- **Pharmacy Role**: Access to pharmacy dashboard and prescription management
- **Laboratory Role**: Access to laboratory dashboard and test management
- **Institution Role**: Smart routing based on institution type

#### Protected Routes:
All institution routes are protected with `ProtectedRoute` component ensuring proper authentication and authorization.

### üì± Navigation & Routing

#### Sidebar Navigation Updated:
- Hospital navigation menu with 4 main sections
- Pharmacy navigation menu with 4 main sections  
- Laboratory navigation menu with 4 main sections
- Smart institution home routing based on user type

#### Route Structure:
```
/hospital/*
  - /dashboard (main dashboard)
  
/pharmacy/*
  - /dashboard (main dashboard)
  
/laboratory/*
  - /dashboard (main dashboard)
```

## üîÑ Data Flow & Integration

### Patient Search Integration:
- **Unified Search**: Same search mechanism (first name, last name, CNE) across all institutions
- **Shared Patient Data**: All institutions can access the same patient database
- **Cross-Institution Visibility**: Pharmacies can see prescriptions from any doctor, labs can see test requests from any doctor/hospital

### Workflow Integration:
1. **Doctor** prescribes medication ‚Üí **Pharmacy** can see and dispense
2. **Doctor/Hospital** requests tests ‚Üí **Laboratory** can see and process
3. **Hospital** admits patient ‚Üí All institutions can see patient status
4. **Laboratory** completes tests ‚Üí **Doctor/Hospital** can see results
