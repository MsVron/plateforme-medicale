- Transaction safety implemented for critical operations

### 4. Route Structure
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED
- Institution-specific routes properly namespaced:
  - `/api/hospital/*` for hospital operations
  - `/api/pharmacy/*` for pharmacy operations
  - `/api/laboratory/*` for laboratory operations
- No route conflicts detected between different institution types

## ✅ Critical Issues RESOLVED

### Issue #1: Pharmacy Medication Dispensing Parameter Mismatch
- **Severity**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Location**: Frontend `pharmacyService.js` vs Backend `pharmacyRoutes.js`
- **Problem**: Parameter name mismatch between frontend and backend
- **Fix Applied**: Updated frontend service to use `prescriptionMedicationId` parameter

### Issue #2: Missing Hospital Doctors Endpoint
- **Severity**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Location**: Frontend `hospitalService.js` and Backend `hospitalRoutes.js`
- **Problem**: Missing hospital-specific doctors endpoint
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Added `/hospital/doctors` route in backend
  - Implemented `getHospitalDoctors` controller function
  - Updated frontend service to use correct endpoint

### Issue #3: Invalid Hospital Pending Work Reference
- **Severity**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Location**: Frontend test utility
- **Problem**: Test utility referenced non-existent `/hospital/pending-work` endpoint
- **Fix Applied**: Updated test utility to check `/hospital/doctors` instead

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Identified

### Issue #4: Missing Backend Test Utility
- **Severity**: 🟡 MINOR
- **Location**: Frontend documentation references `src/utils/backendTest.js`
- **Problem**: File was missing (now created)
- **Impact**: Developers couldn't verify API connectivity
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (Created during this analysis)

### Issue #5: Inconsistent Error Handling
- **Severity**: 🟡 MINOR
- **Location**: Various service files
- **Problem**: Some services have mock endpoints that return hardcoded data
- **Impact**: Statistics and dashboard data may be inaccurate
- **Fix Required**: Implement actual backend endpoints for statistics

- Returns hospital-specific doctors with specialties and contact information

### ✅ Fix #3: Updated Hospital Service
- Updated `getHospitalDoctors` function in `hospitalService.js`
- Now calls the correct `/hospital/doctors` endpoint instead of fallback

### ✅ Fix #4: Updated Test Reference
- Updated `backendTest.js` to test `/hospital/doctors` endpoint
- Removed invalid `/hospital/pending-work` reference

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness Checklist

- [x] Fix pharmacy medication dispensing parameter mismatch
- [x] Implement hospital doctors endpoint
- [x] Update hospital service to use correct doctors endpoint
- [x] Remove invalid hospital pending-work references
- [ ] Test all endpoints with proper authentication tokens
- [ ] Verify database connection and environment variables
- [ ] Run integration tests with backend test utility

## 🔍 Testing Recommendations

1. **Start Backend Server**: Ensure backend runs on port 5000
2. **Database Setup**: Run `sql_structure/master_install.sql`
3. **Create Test Data**: Add sample institutions and users for each type
4. **Run Integration Tests**: Use the provided `backendTest.js` utility
5. **Manual Testing**: Test each institution type's core workflows
